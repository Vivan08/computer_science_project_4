Project Description  
  
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based Python project where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is found.

✔ Random number generated automatically  
✔ Unlimited attempts — user plays until correct guess  
✔ Hints after every guess (Too High / Too Low)  
✔ Input validation to prevent crashes
