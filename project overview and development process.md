The Number Guessing Game is a console-based Python application in which the system generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it correctly. After each attempt, the program provides hints to help the user adjust their next guess by indicating whether the previous guess was too high or too low. When the user finally guesses the number correctly, the program displays the total number of attempts taken.  
  
This project demonstrates key programming concepts including:  
  
Input and output handling  
  
Conditional statements  
  
Loops  
  
Random number generation  
  
Error handling  
  
The project is simple and interactive, and serves as an introductory application for beginners in Python programming.  

  Development Process  
  
The development process was carried out systematically using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub, following the assignment guidelines.  
  
🔹 Step 1 — Project Planning  
  
The first step was selecting a suitable mini project. Based on the assignment options, the Number Guessing Game using Python was chosen because it is ideal for understanding logic building and user interaction.  
  
🔹 Step 2 — Coding and Testing  
  
The game was implemented step-by-step:  
  
Imported the random module to generate a secret number.  
  
Displayed a welcome message and input instructions to the user.  
  
Implemented a loop to accept guesses until the correct number was found.  
  
Added hints to guide the user (Too High / Too Low).  
  
Added error handling (try–except) to avoid crashes when non-numeric input is entered.  
  
Tested the program multiple times to ensure smooth user experience.  
  
🔹 Step 3 — Version Control with Git  
  
Git commands were used throughout development:  
   
git init to initialize repository  
  
git add and git commit to track each update  
  
Multiple meaningful commits were made to document progress  
  
🔹 Step 4 — Repository Hosting on GitHub  
  
After development and testing:  
  
The repository was created on GitHub  
  
Remote origin was added and project was pushed using git push  
  
A .gitignore file was added to exclude unnecessary files  
  
README.md was created for documentation and usage instructions  
  
🔹 Step 5 — Project Presentation  
  
Screenshots of the program output were captured and added to a screenshots folder.  
The screenshot was displayed inside the README using Markdown image syntax
